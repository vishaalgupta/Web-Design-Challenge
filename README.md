# Web-Design-Challenge

# This Dashboard shows the results of our weather analysis that shows the results of different latitudes on temperature, humdity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The landing page gives a summary of the analysis and links to the individual graphs that were created as well as links to a comparison page and a data page.

# There are four visualization pages that each show an individual graph. Each graph plots latitude against a weather field. There is one for temperature, humdity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

# The comparison page shows all four graphs on one page. The data page includes a table with all of the data used to create the graphs.
